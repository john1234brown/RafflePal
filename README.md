- This Raffle Chain you create you can tax upto 2% fee on the jackpots, Also we charge a 3% Fee for all Jackpots consider it a Developer or Server Fee. Also The Jackpot covers the cost for Transaction fees, Conversion Fees etc.. so to clarify Jackpot Winners actually Only Earn about 90% of the Jackpot because of Conversion Fees and Transaction Fees.

- 2% for Raffle Chain Creator Fee.
- 3% for Developers / Server Fees.
- Each Raffle Has a Max entry to set a Max Potential Jackpot of $2,000,000.00 so example formula to find out max entrys for that raffle do (2,000,000/RaffleType)

# FAQ Section
- 
- 
- How do i see Previous Records Or Draw Historys Or Winnings That are more then 90 Days OLD Please Check the [Previous Draw Histroy](https://github.com/john1234brown/RafflePal/blob/main/PreviousDrawHistory/PreviousDrawHistory.json)

# Extra Information Section
- This layout will be better later on i'll have a version history log and such tutorials along with all that good stuff but for now focused on the Backened Stuff mainly.
- We would like to redesign the wheel as you would say everyone loves raffles but nowadays you have to physically be there and dont let get me started on how you cant buy raffle ticket with crypto so we introduce to you the very first Worldwide International Crypto Raffle which is as easy as joining the discord server and enter the raffle via our Discord Bot which he will ask you few questions if you want to make a custom order on amount of tickets. Or you use his command line interface to choose the rafflechain you want to enter on predefined amount of tickets which is 1, 5, 10!
- Or with our Browser Extension which allows you to enter in a very secure manner or create your own raffle chain and allow us to sell tickets for you and handling the payouts!

- Or with a phone app although we mostly expect the entries will be through website and discord bot.
- So phone app and our software is not really in to fast of development!

- Or with a Software on Windows, or using our command line interface in Java for Linux or Mac!

- Or you can enter the raffle just by visiting our website right here > https://www.templatewebsiteblahblahblah.com,

- If thats not enough to convince you well I got more to tell you we also want to create a worlds first divided Centralized sadly Decentralized Runs quite alot of security risks which I don't want to really have to discuss. Lets just say its ALOT of issues with it being Decentralized so Centralizing it will help to cut out alot of these issues and Scams going on! Crypto Raffle Jackpot Smart Contract Chain with multiwinners up to 10 at first and as we grow we will expand to eventually 100 to 1000 and if we reach the dream goal will have a Divided raffle jackpot of upto 100,000 people now seriously i really do want to upscale this more so come on and make this a reality plan to make it auto pick the amount of winners based on the amount of entries and such and as long as payout threshold would be above 20 to 40 or 100.
Also we include a few free raffals you can enter to win daily NFT's we are mostly doing this to grow in popularity and build a fan base And To Prove We Are Legit!!!!

- Did you think thats all i had to say nooo you thought wrong! Well anyways enough with the hype seriously though you will be able to enter the raffle via Minecraft using ForgeMod or via a Minecraft Server through a custom Inventory you access with a command. A few other video games we are going to support are Garry's Mod lame i know, Skyrim through Workshop Mod, World of Warcraft through the Addons, Unturned either through a Rocket Plugin or Workshop Mod, Rust either through Server Plugin or Workshop Mod, etc.. And any other video games we might see compatability with our network in the future even include some public docs on how the minecraft server plugin works in Java and some Unturned in C#.


# End Project Goals
- Public web browser extension for entry's and creating own raffle chains
- All though all this is working it still needs a few security functions put in place before public release of entries is allowed!
- For now everything is being tested and tried over and over again to ensure every user is fully Secure and to allow a Public Decentralized Blockchain of Winners Wallet Address, Payout Type, Payout Chain, Jackpot Amount, Raffle Type, Raffle Amount, and eventually a Raffle Chain
- Centralized Raffle Blockchain with Decentralized Raffle Smart Contracts(Programming Knowledge NOT! Needed), Payment and payout supported by Crypto
- Have public app that is released that will allow any user to create there own chain securely using our future website or through our Fully Functional Discord Bot which you can direct message or message it on our discord server, and eventually from within a video game! and messaged to you either by the Discord Bot, or 
- We plan on having this fully released by the new year of March 1 2023! atleast just the Entering on our Raffle chain system to test and debug things with the NFT's then we will work on the Private Chains but still can publicly enter Through our Discord bot or using or Public Release Discord Bot which you will be able to host within your server and it will communicate with ours and vice versa Entering the Raffle In the Test phase will be completely Free NO Charges Obviously!
- Custom Livestream Giveaway Raffle Chains for Sponsored Item Giveaways to generate a little extra revenue with a 1$ raffle ticket entry! and you keep the earnings with the server keeping a percentage fee for processing and drawing the winner in a secure manner no more then 0.5%! which ever equates to atleast a 1$ to able to transfer due to minimum transfer amounts with Coinbase and Cryptocurrency!
